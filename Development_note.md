# Development note
Everything interesting when we develop this code.

## Display driver
Lilygo only provided driver for Arduino platform.
But there are other drivers aviliable for ESP-IDF.

- [lvgl port for esp32](https://github.com/lvgl/lv_port_esp32)
- [ESP32 TFT library](https://github.com/loboris/ESP32_TFT_library)

[LVGL](https://docs.lvgl.io/7.11/) is a graphic library that looks very useful.
