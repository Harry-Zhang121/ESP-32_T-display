# Development note
Everything interesting when we develop this code.

## Code repo
The first working example is commit `c073f1a`. You should see "It is working!" printed on the display.

## Hardware config
![Hardware](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/T-Display-S3/raw/main/image/T-DISPLAY-S3.jpg)


## Display driver
Lilygo only provided driver for Arduino platform.
But there are other drivers aviliable for ESP-IDF.

- [lvgl port for esp32](https://github.com/lvgl/lv_port_esp32)
- [ESP32 TFT library](https://github.com/loboris/ESP32_TFT_library)

[LVGL](https://docs.lvgl.io/7.11/) is a graphic library that looks very useful.

## Example project
[Offical esp-idf example using LVGL](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/v4.4.3/examples/peripherals/lcd/lvgl)

## Issues that I encountered

### Boot loop
Add this to `platformio.ini` 
```
board_build.flash_mode = dio
```
[For more, Check this](https://github.com/platformio/platform-espressif32/issues/622)

### Display driver
**The display driver is connected to MCU via Intel 8080 parallel interface. NOT spi!**
**PCLK** = **WR**. Same thing different name.
> The display will write data lines when thereâ€™s a falling edge on WR signal (a.k.a the PCLK)

### Porting IDF project to PlatformIO
[Check this github issue](https://github.com/lvgl/lv_port_esp32/issues/220)


### HSPI undecleared
